# Credit_Risk_Supervised_ML

In this analysis, I built and evaluated several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from "LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company".
The goals are to:

- Implement machine learning models.
- Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

I will use the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data.
Please look into the Jupyter Notebook files to see the code, models, and brief summary and analysis of the modelsâ€™ performance.
